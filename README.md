PileOn Prototype
=================

A web app prototype that connects people to nearby, free piles of materials.

PileOn was initiated by [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org), a [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) brigade, that focuses on improving civic technology for the Twin Cities area.

If you're interested in contributing, visit the [google group thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/twin-cities-brigade/obapXOdsuAs) that discusses this app.
