PileOn Prototype
=================

A web app prototype that connects people to nearby, free piles of materials.

PileOn was initiated by [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org), a [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) brigade, that focuses on improving civic technology for the Twin Cities area.
